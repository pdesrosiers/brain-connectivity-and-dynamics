Dataset Description:
The dataset was generated at the CERVO Brain Research Centre to investigate
functional connectivity in the larval zebrafish brain. It includes whole-brain
calcium imaging data from 5â€“7 dpf (days post-fertilization) transgenic larvae
[Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s)], as well as synchronized tail movement recordings.

Recordings were performed using a Scientifica SliceScope resonant two-photon
microscope across 21 z-planes (~12 Âµm spacing) using a piezo-driven objective.
Tail movement was captured simultaneously at ~400 Hz using infrared illumination
and a high-speed camera beneath the chamber.

This folder includes a limited number of `.npy` files (NumPy format) used for
