# Graph and Dynamical Systems Approaches to Whole-Brain Neuronal Networks

This repository contains interactive Jupyter notebooks prepared for a hands-on session held as part of the **Frontiers in Neurophotonics Summer School 2025**.

## Overview

Modern network science and computational modeling offer powerful tools to analyze brain connectivity and neuronal dynamics. In this hands-on session, you will explore how to represent structural and functional brain networks as graphs, extract meaningful features, and simulate activity using biologically inspired models.

## Notebooks

### 1. Structural and Functional Network Analysis

This notebook guides you through:

- **Analyzing structural connectivity** from zebrafish brain data  
- **Computing graph-theoretical features** such as degree, clustering, and path metrics  
- **Inferring functional connectivity** from calcium imaging data  
- **Quantifying structure‚Äìfunction coupling** using correlation and node-level metrics

### 2. Neural Dynamics Simulation

This notebook focuses on:

- **Simulating single-neuron dynamics** and generating synthetic calcium traces  
- **Modeling population-level activity** in zebrafish-inspired neural circuits  
- **Comparing simulated activity with empirical patterns** from calcium imaging
