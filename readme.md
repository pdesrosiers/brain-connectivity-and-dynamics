# Graph and Dynamical Systems Approaches to Whole-Brain Neuronal Networks

This repository contains interactive Jupyter notebooks prepared for a hands-on session held as part of the **Frontiers in Neurophotonics Summer School 2025**.

---
## Overview

Modern network science and computational modeling offer powerful tools to analyze brain connectivity and neuronal dynamics. In this hands-on session, you will explore how to represent structural and functional brain networks as graphs, extract meaningful features, and simulate activity using biologically inspired models.

## Notebooks

### 1. Structural and Functional Network Analysis

This notebook guides you through:

- **Analyzing structural connectivity** from zebrafish brain data  
- **Computing graph-theoretical features** such as degree, clustering, and path metrics  
- **Inferring functional connectivity** from calcium imaging data  
- **Quantifying structure‚Äìfunction coupling** using correlation and node-level metrics

</a>


### 2. Neural Dynamics Simulation

This notebook focuses on:

- **Simulating single-neuron dynamics** and generating synthetic calcium traces  
- **Modeling population-level activity** in zebrafish-inspired neural circuits  
- **Comparing simulated activity with empirical patterns** from calcium imaging

## Getting Started

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

You can run each notebook directly in your browser using **Google Colab** ‚Äî no installation required. Just click the **"Open in Colab"** badge provided under each notebook title.

Make sure you're logged into a Google account and accept any permissions required to access files.

üíæ To save your changes, go to

```File ‚Üí Save a copy in Drive```

This creates a private, editable version of the notebook in your own Google Drive.

### üñ•Ô∏è Run Locally (Optional ‚Äì for advanced users)

If you prefer to run the notebooks on your own machine:

1. Clone the repository 

	```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pdesrosiers/Graph-and-dynamical-systems-approaches-to-whole-brain-neuronal-networks.git
   cd Graph-and-dynamical-systems-approaches-to-whole-brain-neuronal-networks
   ```
	
2.	Install the required Python packages

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
	
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

	```bash 
	jupyter notebook
	```
